/*
 a. Messages.en is the definitive hand-crafted list of messages in the project, so never auto generated.
 b. csv file is generated from messages.en, plus matched cy content, from tracked csv file (when available).
 c. Is cy line is found in csv?, compare line in csv with line in messages.en. Outcome: [New message / Message changed / Already translated]
 d. Messages.cy is always a straight generation from a csv file. New/Untranslated En messages are ignored (for now).


 1. Create application, using Play i18n, with text in Messages file(s)
 2. Run conversion, to create a csv file, from the Messages file(s)
 3. Track csv in Git and send file to translators.
 4. Receive csv back, with translations populated.
 5. Check this new csv into Git, superseeding the one in step 3.
 6. Extract the Welsh translations from the file, using this tool.
 7. Run the Tool against the messages.en. If the newly created csv highlights any changes,
     then the csv will need to be sent back to translators. The lines which have changed will be marked in the file.
 8. Send screenshots to translation team, for confirmation.
